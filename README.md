# Call Prediction Analysis

This is a part of the major project made for an electronics branch student.
This utility is basically a Swing Project using some excel files and applying some Telecom concepts to it and making the graphs and finding likelines of a call failure.
This is made on Eclipse luna.
I have used JFreeCharts to show the BarCharts and used Apache POI XSSF for reading and writing the Excel files.
